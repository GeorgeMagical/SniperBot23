What to know?

Front-running is trading stock or any other financial asset by a broker who has inside knowledge of a future transaction that is about 
to affect its price substantially. What is front-running in crypto? The term ‚Äúfront-running‚Äù refers to the process when someone uses 
technology or market advantage to get prior knowledge of upcoming transactions.

*MY ETHEREUM WALLET SHOWING PROCEEDS FROM FRONT-RUNNING‚Ä¶

Important: I didn‚Äôt make all that in a month, it was a gradual process.

About me? I‚Äôm a Solidity and web3 developer.

How did i make so much? Read on‚Ä¶

After the market crash earlier this year, I was sacked by 5 Crypto exchanges and a lot of projects stopped working with me because of the market crash. 
I was owing rent by March but I didn‚Äôt give up. I started looking for ways to make money and I asked myself, what‚Äôs the best way to know the price of a 
future token or coin, then act on it. Hence I came up with the idea of a Frontrunning bot which allows me to automatically buy before others and sell 
immediately after they buy to make profit. All I had was 1 ETH and an internet connection. With that, I was able to increase it to 12 ETH.

The journey hasn‚Äôt quite been easy,
But I‚Äôve made it this far and can only go further.

Out of my generosity, I shared the code as well as the step by step process in my video HERE for free. However, 
I‚Äôll only update the code Up until 15th December 2023. So my method STILL Works until 15th December 2023, after which i cannot guarantee profits, 
this is because I‚Äôll be traveling to Mauritius in order to avoid Winter! Mauritius is nice this time of the year. 
While away, i will not be able to update the code. This does not mean that the code will stop working exactly on that date but that‚Äôs the date I‚Äôll drop 
the last update and profits will trickle down eventually. Thanks for understanding üôè

A bridge between CEX and DEX, etc
